# _Leap year detector_

#### _enter a year to see if it is, was, or will be a leap year, 04/02/2019_

#### By _**Hannah Melendy; Epicodus**_

## Description

_{This is a detailed description of your application. Its purpose and usage.  Give as much detail as needed to explain what the application does, and any other information you want users or other developers to have. }_

_Behavior-Driven Development Process
1. Identify Specifications/Behaviors
Identify the behaviors your program should exhibit. Include example input and output that would demonstrate this behavior is working.

Make sure each behavior truly is a single behavior. In the leap year example, checking that the number is divisible by 400 and checking if the number is divisible by 4 are two seperate ways to check for a leap year, and are therefore two separate behaviors, even though they both result in the program returning true.

2. Code the Behaviors
Beginning with the simplest possible behavior, add the least amount of code to integrate this behavior into the application.

3. Test
In level 2 courses, you will write automated tests to check your code. In Intro to Programming we will test manually. Enter the example input that corresponds to your first specification. Check to see if you receive the example output.

If not, it's evident that the behavior is not functioning as expected, and you'll need to revisit your code.

4. Commit
If you do receive the correct output, your spec passes! Each time a new test passes, you'll want to commit your work.

5. Repeat!
Repeat this same process for each specification. Begin with the simplest possible spec, and work your way up in complexity.

Refactor
Whenever necessary, refactor between specifications. Just ensure your previously passing specs still pass after refactoring._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _This is a great place_
* _to list setup instructions_
* _in a simple_
* _easy-to-understand_
* _format_

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}_

## Link to GitHub Pages

_The link for your gh-pages sites will_
_always be formatted like this: _

_yourusername.github.io/yourprojectname_

## Known Bugs

_{Are there issues that have not yet been resolved that you want to let users know you know?  Outline any issues that would impact use of your application.  Share any workarounds that are in place. }_

## Support and contact details

_{Let people know what to do if they run into any issues or have questions, ideas or concerns.  Encourage them to contact you or make a contribution to the code.}_

## Technologies Used

_{Tell me about the languages and tools you used to create this app. Assume that I know you probably used HTML and CSS. If you did something really cool using only HTML, point that out.}_
